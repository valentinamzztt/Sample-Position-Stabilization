#  	EnumerationEvents.py explores arrival and removal events on interfaces and the system.
#   It relies on information provided in the Enumeration, Acquisition, and NodeMapInfo examples.
#
#  	It can also be helpful to familiarize yourself with the NodeMapCallback example,
#   as nodemap callbacks follow the same general procedure as events, but with a few less steps.
#
#  	This example creates two user-defined classes: InterfaceEventHandler and SystemEventHandler.
#   These child classes allow the user to define properties, parameters, and the event itself
#   while the parent classes - ArrivalEvent, RemovalEvent, and InterfaceEvent -
#   allow the child classes to interface with Spinnaker.
